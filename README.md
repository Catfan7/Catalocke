# Catalocke

First Minecraft Prison, 
Spigot 1.17

Version 0:
-Prison is created

Version 1:
Redstone lines are converted to observer-noteblock chains  
Cell changed from timed-push box to cobblestone generator  
Respawn area redone  
Sections color coded  
Guard room expanded  
Every room is accessable by guard  
More item bans on outer defense  
Elder guardians are added  
Mining detector redone  
Outside turned from big obsidian cube to layer of concrete on the outside (but still an obsidian cube)  
End exploit prevention  
Mostly everything is in crawl mode  
Really obscure Portal reference  
Overall better  

Version 2:
Guard Controls Rearranged  
Added Item Vault  
Added Control Guard Autopanic  
Submerged Entry Hallways  
Added Conduit  
Added Area Ban Diagram on top of prison  
Section of Guard Rooms that was areabanned by Portal Kicker is now blocked off when kicker is on

Version 3:
Added 12-block thick lava grid  
Ban Machines now have space where redstone torch used to be before theoretically breaking it and stasising out right away, therefore the ban machines are actually possible  
Added water in the guard chutes (so no more fall damage)  
Made item vault actually leavable when closing the door on yourself (noteblock in floor opens sea lantern)  
No more ideas, cannot majorly improve Catalocke without redesigning it... I might do that
